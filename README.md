# Driplane: Web Automation Testing Project

Driplane is an automation testing project developed using **Java Selenium**, **TestNG**, and **Maven**. This project aims to optimize the testing process of web applications by leveraging Selenium's powerful automation capabilities and TestNG's robust testing framework.

## Key Features:

- **Selenium WebDriver:** Used for interacting with web elements. It automates tasks such as form filling, clicking, and page navigation.
- **TestNG Framework:** Provides a structured and efficient way to organize test cases, manage test suites, and generate detailed test reports. It supports parallel execution, data-driven testing, and test prioritization.
- **Maven Build Tool:** Simplifies project management by handling dependencies, build lifecycles, and project structure. Ensures consistent builds and easy integration with Continuous Integration (CI) tools.

## Project Structure:

1. **Page Objects:** Follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. Each web page is represented as a separate class that encapsulates its elements and actions.
2. **Test Classes:** TestNG test classes contain test methods that interact with page objects, perform validations, and verify expected outcomes.
3. **Test Data:** Managed externally (e.g., in Excel, JSON, or feature files) for flexibility and reusability.
4. **Configuration:** The `pom.xml` file manages dependencies, plugins, and profiles for Maven. Browser configurations (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) are specified here.
5. **Reports:** TestNG generates HTML reports with detailed information about test execution. These reports include success/failure statuses, execution time, and stack traces.

## How to Use:

1. **Clone the Repository:** `git clone https://github.com/your_username/driplane.git`
2. **Build with Maven:** `mvn clean test`
3. **View Reports:** Find HTML reports in the `target/surefire-reports` folder.
